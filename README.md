**This is very much a Readme.**

This is a project where we try to first find drug-drug similarity and then
recommend pairs of drugs with high similarity but only minor interactions.

First, clone the repo onto your computer.

If possible, use branches for your individual changes, and then use pull
requests to get your code reviewed and added to the master branch.
